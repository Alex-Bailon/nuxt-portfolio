In fact, in the latter half of the bootcamp I brought him on to do some freelance work for the company I work for, Fusion92. He exhibited mastery of the full range of disciplines we went over in class (nodejs backend, html/css/js, React, Mongo, SQL, and deployments). He'd be a great developer to have on any team!\"",

I had no prior experience with Vue and Nuxt before my time at Mint Werx, however, Alex's guidance and encouragement were invaluable in helping me grow as a developer. He was always willing to lend his expertise and support, which made the learning process much smoother. As a collaborator, Alex was incredibly reliable and trustworthy. He was instrumental in implementing the designs I created in Figma, ensuring that they were accurately reflected on the final website. I particularly appreciated his patience and thoughtfulness when it came to designing for scroll-telling and dynamic sites, which are becoming increasingly popular in today's digital landscape. Alex took the time to fully understand my vision and worked to make it a reality. I highly recommend Alex as a front-end developer. He is an excellent team player and collaborator, and his technical skills are second to none. His patience, thoughtfulness, and dedication to his craft make him an asset to any project he works on.\"",
